Ever since high school, my interest in coding has steadily grown as I started learning languages and practicing the application of them using resources such as SoloLearn and W3schools. 
I arrived here as I was looking for schools and programs that offered an education in the field of coding that was a bit more structured and focused. Although I am in the process of finishing school, I realized that 10 years from now I would regret not taking a step towards a field I've been passionate about for a majority of my life. 

So far on this journey,  I’ve found myself relearning certain concepts concerning Ruby and SQL. I feel that the internet (particularly YouTube) is a good resource for learning different ways to approach coding scenarios. I’ve also made it a habit of mine to bookmark certain labs for future reference. Redoing labs such as the deli counter has been very useful also. I’m learning that to be successful in learning languages, practice is the key.
