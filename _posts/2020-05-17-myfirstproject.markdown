Despite having to build an environment from scratch, this was one of the more fun assignments of this course. One of reasons I say this particular assignment was fun was because of the next level of creativity and independence given. Having the internet as a sole resource for issues I arrived at has helped me gain insight on the many ways to problem solve.  One thing in particular that I learned first hand was the importance of the roles each method/class has to play in relation to the entire project. Another was how simple certain classes needed to be, and where to allocate detailed lines of code. All in all, I hope to be able to improve and continue to use all the info I've learned so far.
