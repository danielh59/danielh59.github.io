So far, I've learned a great deal of coding methods and approaches to problem solving that I've found very useful. One approach that I picked up on during the course would be abstract thinking, and how crucial it could be when writing blocks of code to be passable in a multitude of scenarios. Labs such as the Tic Tac Toe and Cash Register have aslso helped me with the application of what I've learned so far. I continue to look forward to the material I will learn, as I  experiment with methods that will prove useful down the line.
